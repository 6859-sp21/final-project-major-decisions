          <h3> Analyzing US airport and airline data </h3>
          We collected data regarding US airlines and airports on-time statistics and delay causes from United States Department of Transportation's
          <a href="https://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp?pn=1">Bureau of Transportation Statistics website.</a>

        We collected data spanned from January 2016 to March 2021. The data includes information on total number and delayed number of flights
        per airline per airport per months.
        <br>
        We examined the following delay types:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Air Carrier:</strong> Delay due to circumstances within airline's control, e.g. maintenance problems, fueling, etc.
          <li><strong>Extreme Weather:</strong> Significant meteorological conditions (actual or forecasted) delay/prevent flight operation.
          <li><strong>National Aviation System (NAS):</strong> Delays/cancellations attributable to NAS-defined conditions, e.g. non-extreme weather conditions, airport operations, heavy traffic volume, and air traffic control.
          <li><strong>Late-arriving aircraft:</strong> A previous flight with same aircraft arrived late, causing the present flight to depart late.
          <li><strong>Security:</strong> Delays or cancellations caused by terminal/concourse evacuation, re-boarding of aircraft because of security breach, inoperative screening equipment and/or long lines in excess of 29 minutes at screening areas.
        </ul>
        <br>
        We performed the following analysis.

        We calculated the percentage of delayed flights per flight carrier per year. So which are the <b>worst</b> airlines?

        We examined each airline's monthly reported number of delayed flights between January 2016 and March 2021. To better compare the proportion of delayed flights across airlines, we normalized the delay counts by the total number of arriving flights per airline.
        <br>
        This visualization shows the number of delays per 10,000 arriving flights. To explore changes in delay counts and types over time, select an airline from the dropdown. You can also brush to zoom into a time period or double-click to reset the time scale. You can also hover over the legend to highlight a delay type.
